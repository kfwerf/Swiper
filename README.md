Isomorphic Swiper
==========

Simple changes to the original iDangerous Swiper, to allow it to be used in node.js enviroments.
Takes away assumptions of window, document and navigator.

In future version maybe there is a build script to automate this Swiper to become isomorphic.

To build just hit:

      gulp
